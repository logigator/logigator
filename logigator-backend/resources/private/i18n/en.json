			"TITLE": "What is Logigator",
			"VIDEO": "weTeJLMGq_Q",
			"TEXT": "Logigator is an online simulator for logic gates which enables the user to build and simulate circuits with logic gates. For example, one can build half-adders and full-adders which can be used for learning. Whether one wants to experiment and explore boolean functions or design new and complex circuits - Logigator is the right tool. <br> In addition, Logigator offers high performance even with large-scale projects. By using “WebAssembly” (https://webassembly.org/), the website can reach simulation speeds that would not be possible in a browser otherwise."
		},
		"GENERAL": {
			"TITLE": "General",
			"VIDEO": "tX7HT_0MZRo",
			"TEXT": "The editor can be reached under https://logigator.com/editor and can be used to design and simulate circuits. <br> To place an element, simply select the wanted element from the construction-kit on the left side of the window. The basic gates consist of: AND, OR, XOR, NOT as well as a delay which doesn't change the input signal and a clock, which outputs a signal in periodical intervals. Naturally, there are also more complex elements which are not mentioned here. After one selects an element, it can be placed by clicking anywhere in the canvas. Using the selection-tool one can select an element and change settings in the box in the bottom right corner. These settings vary from component to component. The wire-tool can then be used to connect the elements."
		},
		"CUSTOM_COMPS": {
			"TITLE": "Custom Components",
			"VIDEO": "fSErH93I-Wg",
			"TEXT": "One might want to use a part of a circuit multiple times. To simplify this process it is possible to define custom components, which can easily be placed multiple times and can even be used in other projects. <br> There are two types of plug components: inputs and outputs. By placing these components one can mark the inputs and outputs of a custom components. Additionally parts of circuits can be labeled for better overview."
		},
		"SIMULATION": {
			"TITLE": "Simulation Mode",
			"VIDEO": "WjpChcxn18k",
			"TEXT": "The simulation-mode can be used to test and simulate circuits. To switch to simulation mode, simply press the “Start Simulation” button. To start the simulation simply press the play button. Now you can interact with the circuit. In case you want to see what the circuit is doing, you can pause the simulation and test it step by step. To return to the original state simply press the stop button. By default the simulation will run as fast as possible. However, the clock speed can be changed by simply entering the wanted speed or locking it to the display's frequency. The composition of custom components can be observed by simply clicking on them."

You recognize the use of this protection of the Data transfer at the small lock symbol in the top left of the browser and the use of the https scheme (instead of http) as part of our internet address.</p><h2>Google reCAPTCHA privacy policy</h2><p>Our primary goal is to ensure that our website is as protected and secure as possible for you and for us. To that We use Google reCAPTCHA from Google Inc. (1600 Amphitheater Parkway Mountain View, CA 94043, USA). With reCAPTCHA we can determine whether you are really a person made of flesh and blood and not a robot or any other spam software. By spam we mean any, electronically, unwanted information that comes to us unsolicited. With the classic CAPTCHAS you had to go to Review mostly solve text or picture puzzles. With reCAPTCHA from Google, we usually don't have to deal with them Pester puzzles. In most cases it is sufficient to simply tick the box and confirm that that you are not a bot. With the new Invisible reCAPTCHA version you don't even have to check the box anymore. In the course of this you will learn exactly how this works and, above all, which data is used for it Privacy Policy.</p><h3>What is reCAPTCHA?</h3><p>reCAPTCHA is a free captcha service from Google that protects websites from spam software and misuse protects non-human visitors. Most often this service is used when using forms on the internet to complete. A captcha service is an automatic Turing test that is designed to ensure that an action is in the Internet is made by a human, not a bot. In the classic Turing test (named after the computer scientist Alan Turing) a human discovers the distinction between bot and human. With captchas This is also done by the computer or a software program. Classic captchas work with small tasks, which are easy to solve for humans, but have considerable difficulties for machines. At reCAPTCHA you no longer have to actively solve puzzles. The tool uses modern risk techniques to keep people from bots distinguish. Here you only have to tick the text field \"I am not a robot\" or in the Invisible field reCAPTCHA even that is no longer necessary. With reCAPTCHA, a JavaScript element is included in the source code integrated and then the tool runs in the background and analyzes your user behavior. From these user actions the software calculates a so-called captcha score. Google uses this score to calculate before the Captcha input of the probability that you are human. ReCAPTCHA or Captchas in In general, bots are always used when certain actions (such as registrations, surveys, etc.) manipulate or abuse.</p><h3>Why do we use reCAPTCHA on our website?</h3><p>We only want to welcome people of flesh and blood to our side. Bots or spam software of all kinds can stay at home with confidence. That is why we are pulling out all the stops to protect ourselves and to offer you the best possible usability. This is why we use Google reCAPTCHA the company Google. So we can be pretty sure that we will remain a “bot-free” website. Through the When using reCAPTCHA, data is transmitted to Google, which Google uses to determine whether you are too are really human. reCAPTCHA therefore serves the security of our website and consequently also Your safety. For example, without reCAPTCHA it could happen that a bot Registered as many e-mail addresses as possible in order to follow up forums or blogs with unsolicited advertising content \"Zuzuspamen\". With reCAPTCHA we can avoid such bot attacks.</p><h3>Which data is saved by reCAPTCHA?</h3><p>ReCAPTCHA collects personal data from users in order to determine whether the actions on our website also occur really come from humans. So it can be the IP address and other data that Google uses for the reCAPTCHA service needs to be sent to Google. IP addresses are used within the member states of the EU or others Contracting states to the Agreement on the European Economic Area almost always shortened before the data end up on a server in the USA. The IP address is not combined with other data from Google, provided that You are not signed in to your Google account while using reCAPTCHA. First he checks reCAPTCHA algorithm, whether Google cookies from other Google services (YouTube. Gmail etc.) are placed. ReCAPTCHA then sets an additional cookie in your browser and records one Snapshot of your browser window.</p><p>The following list of collected browser and user data does not claim to be exhaustive. Much more are examples of data that, to our knowledge, are processed by Google.</p><ul> <li>Referrer URL (the address of the page from which the visitor comes)</li><li>IP address (e.g. 256.123.123.1)</li><li>Information about the operating system (the software that runs your computer enables. Known operating systems are Windows, Mac OS X or Linux)</li><li>Cookies (small text files that save data in your browser)</li><li>Mouse and keyboard behavior (any action you take with the mouse or keyboard execute is saved)</li><li>Date and language settings (which language or which date you want on your PC preset will be saved)</li><li>All Javascript objects (JavaScript is a programming language that makes web pages allows to adapt to the user. JavaScript objects can hold all kinds of data under one name collect)</li><li>Screen resolution (shows how many pixels are used to display the image consists)</li></ul><p>It is undisputed that Google uses and analyzes this data even before you click the “I am not a Robot \"click. With the Invisible reCAPTCHA version, even the ticking is omitted and the whole thing The recognition process runs in the background. You can find out exactly how much and what data Google stores from Google not in detail.</p><p>The following cookies are used by reCAPTCHA: Here we refer to the reCAPTCHA demo version of Google at <a href=\"https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api2/demo\" target=\"_ blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external\">https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api2/demo</a> .

Well-known browsers are for example Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge. Most websites save small ones Text files in your browser. These files are called cookies.</p><p>One thing cannot be dismissed out of hand: Cookies are really useful little helpers. Almost all websites use cookies. More precisely, they are HTTP cookies, as there are other cookies for others Areas of application there. HTTP cookies are small files that our website stores on your computer get saved. These cookie files are automatically stored in the cookie folder, in the \"brain\" of your browser, housed. A cookie consists of a name and a value. When defining a cookie you must one or more attributes can also be specified.</p><p>Cookies store certain user data from you, such as language or personal page settings. When you visit our site again, your browser transmits the \"user-related\" information to our site back. Thanks to cookies, our website knows who you are and offers you the settings that you are used to are. In some browsers each cookie has its own file, in others such as Firefox all cookies are saved in a single file.</p><p>There are both first-party cookies and third-party cookies.

At this point we would like to briefly look at the various Types of HTTP cookies received.</p><p>There are 4 types of cookies:</p><p><strong>Essential cookies<br></strong> These cookies are necessary to ensure the basic functions of the website. For example needs these cookies, when a user puts a product in the shopping cart, then continues to surf on other pages and goes to the checkout later. These cookies do not delete the shopping cart, even if it is the user Browser window closes.</p><p><strong>Appropriate cookies<br></strong> These cookies collect information about user behavior and whether the user receives any error messages.

They serve the user individually adapted To deliver advertising. That can be very practical, but also very annoying.</p><p>Usually when you visit a website for the first time you will be asked which of these types of cookies you allow would like. And of course this decision is also saved in a cookie.</p><h3>How can I delete cookies?</h3><p>You decide how and whether you want to use cookies.

So you can decide for each individual cookie whether you allow the cookie or not. The procedure is different depending on the browser. The best thing to do is look for them Instructions in Google with the search term “delete cookies Chrome” or “deactivate cookies Chrome” in the case a Chrome browser.</p><h3>How about my data protection?</h3><p>The so-called \"cookie guidelines\" have existed since 2009. It states that the storage of cookies consent required from you. However, there are still very different ones within the EU countries Responses to these guidelines. In Austria, however, this directive was implemented in Section 96 (3) of the Telecommunications Act (TKG).</p><p>If you want to know more about cookies and don't shy away from technical documentation, we recommend <a href=\"https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6265\" target=\"_ blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" class=\"external\">https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6265</a> , the request for comments from the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) called \"HTTP State Management Mechanism\".</p><p style=\"margin-top: 15px;\">Source: Created with the <a title=\"data protection generator from firmenwebseiten.at\" href=\"https://www.firmenwebseiten.at/datenschutz-generator/\" target=\"_ blank\" rel=\"follow\" style=\"text-decoration: none;\">Privacy Generator from firmenwebseiten.at</a> in cooperation with <a href=\"https://www.medwell24.at\" target=\"_ blank\" rel=\"follow\" title=\"\" style=\"text-decoration: none;\">medwell24.at</a></p>",
