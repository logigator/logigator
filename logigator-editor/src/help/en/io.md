## LED Matrix

<div class="rows">

![LED Matrix](../../assets/help/led-matrix.PNG)

<div class="margin-left">

Displays up to 256 single LEDs. It is possible to choose between the following sizes: 4x4, 8x8 and 16x16. 

 - **Address Inputs**<br>
   With the address inputs, the single rows of the matrix can be controlled. When using a 16x16 Matrix, each row is spilt into two addresses (the first 8 LED, the last 8 LEDs).
 
 - **Data Inputs**<br>
   The Matrix has between 4 and 8 data Inputs (D0-D7). D0 is the first LED of the row and D7 is the last LED of the row. A 16x16 Matrix also has only 8 Data Inputs. Because of that, every row consists of two addresses. 

 - **Clock**<br>
   When CLK is HIGH, the data is written to the Matrix.
