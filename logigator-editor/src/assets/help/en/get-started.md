## Creating a Circuit Element

<div class="rows">

![Construction Box](assets/help/construction-box.jpg)

<div class="margin-left">

In order to create a circuit element select the desired element from the construction box, which is located on the left-hand side of the screen.
<br><br>

After selecting an element you can place it by clicking anywhere on the workarea.

<div class="margin-left">

Placed elements can be edited in the Settings box, which is located in the bottom-right corner of the screen.

There you can configure settings like the direction, amount of inputs, or amount of outputs of components.

## Zooming and Panning the View
You can zoom in and out by scrolling your mouse wheel or by pressing the `+` or `-` button in the toolbar.

To pan the view just hold down your right mouse-button and move your mouse.

## Selecting Elements
To select elements click on the desired element or drag a select-rect with your left mouse-button.

#### Select vs. Select Cut

<div class="rows align-center margin-bottom">
	<img src="assets/icons/dark/selection1.svg" title="icon-img" />
	<p class="margin-left">Select</p>
</div>
<div class="rows align-center margin-bottom">
	<img src="assets/icons/dark/selection_cut.svg" title="icon-img" />
	<p class="margin-left">Select Cut</p>
</div>

In `Select` mode wires will be selected to the next corner or the end of the wire.<br>
In contrast, in `Cut Select` Mode wires will only be selected to the edge of the selection-rectangle. Wires will be cut at this edge.

## Placing Wires

<div class="rows align-center">

![Place Wires Icon](assets/icons/dark/connection.svg "icon-img")

<div class="margin-left">
To place wires select this icon in the toolbar.
</div>
</div>
Then you can drag a new wire with your left mouse-button.

## Connecting Wires

<div class="rows align-center">

![Connect Wires Icon](assets/icons/dark/connect_wire.svg "icon-img")

<div class="margin-left">
To connect wires select this icon in the toolbar.
</div>
</div>
Click on the intersection of the wire you want to connect to to this. When you click again, the wires will be disconnected.

## Eraser

<div class="rows align-center">

![Connect Wires Icon](assets/icons/dark/eraser.svg "icon-img")

<div class="margin-left">
To erase elements and wires select this icon in the toolbar.
</div>
</div>
Drag your mouse while holding down your left-mouse button, to erase components and wires.

## Placing Text

<div class="rows align-center">

![Connect Wires Icon](assets/icons/dark/text.svg "icon-img")

<div class="margin-left">
To place text, select this icon in the toolbar.
</div>
</div>
Place the text-field on the workarea, just like a gate.

## Exporting Images
Images of the current circuit can be exported via `File > Export Image`.

## Shortcuts 
Most of the described actions can also be performed with shortcuts. You see and edit shortcuts via `Edit Shortcuts` in the settings menu in the top-right corner of the screen.

## Simulation Ticks
The output of every gate and element gets updated once every simulation tick.
